## Me

Hi, I'm Cedar. Welcome to my personal fishing hole.

I'm a IST student in the pursuit of my MLIS. I do political organizing in MKE, typically with the DSA. I generally advocate for the use of free software for all applications where it's practical for the layman. I'm interested in cybersecurity, political theory, freedom of information, and Minecraft.

If you're an employer, you're probably looking for [my resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SKiEOYEqm010VA3BUhUI_E7HRYK5pvSp7Je_dPUpIsk/edit?usp=sharing).

## Site

This website exists as a creative outlet, distant from the oppresive uniformity of the modern web. Most of the website is hand-coded, though I make use of Eleventy to make recycling elements and writing blog posts easier.
