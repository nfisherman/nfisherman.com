<h5 style="margin-top: 0;">Who am I?</h5>

My name is Cedar Lehman (*they/them*), a student political activist and serial procrastinator.

You can find my social media on [my Linktree](https://linktr.ee/nfisherman).

##### Schooling

I'm an Information Science and Technology student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM), in the pursuit of my Masters in Library and Information Science. I hope one day to be *your* future radical librarian at a Milwaukee Public Library branch near you. 

If you're an employer, you're probably looking for [my resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SKiEOYEqm010VA3BUhUI_E7HRYK5pvSp7Je_dPUpIsk/edit?usp=sharing).

##### Activism

I'm currently the secretary of the [Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) at UWM](https://uwm.mkeydsa.org), a branch of the larger [Milwaukee YDSA](https://mkeydsa.org). When I'm not organizing rallies and pouring over endless paperwork for my campus activism, I'm organizing with the [Milwaukee Anti-War Committee (MAC)](https://www.instagram.com/mkeantiwarcommittee/). I've spent the majority of my time [organizing on campus for a free Palestine](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/education/2024/05/12/uw-milwaukee-strikes-deal-with-protesters-to-taken-down-encampment/73666887007/) and better working conditions for Milwaukee workers. I place special interest in the rapidly deteriorating climate, and often find myself at the intersection of a lot of issues because of it. I generally advocate for the use of free software for all applications where it's practical for the layman.

##### Interests

I'm (unfortunately) a massive nerd and am obsessed with cybersecurity, IT-systems management, political theory, theology, freedom of information, and Minecraft (if I was able to track how many hours I have in this game across my entire life it would easily be over 1000).

## Site

This website exists as a creative outlet, a personal wiki, and a place to put my writing. Most of the website is hand-coded, though I make use of [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) to make recycling elements and writing blog posts easier. I hope to one day run this website entirely off of solar power, inspired by the folks at [Low Tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/), but I can't really do that until I'm able to pay for my own internet and router.
